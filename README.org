* autoftp - automated WLAN file aggregator using NcFTP
Written by Martin Kennedy - Feb 2018 - revised May 2018

Setup:
1) Ensure router automatically connects to SSID of desired routers - passwords do not need to be the same, but it makes things easier to configure.
2) Insert USB flash drive with compatable, mountable filesystem (EXT2/3/4, FAT, NTFS all work.)
3) Ensure router can run reliably on power supply granted; 5V @ 0.5A seems OK.
4) Configure /etc/autoftp/autoftp.defaults.conf.
   1) In particular, ensure the FTP_HOST_NR is correct; this is the host number in the subnet at which the FTP server is to be located.
   2) Also remember to create and set a file to store the files that get automatically pulled down. This is, by default, /mnt/sda1/files.
5) If any of the FTP servers require authentication, modify /etc/autoftp/autoftp.defaults.conf to =ncftp[get|put] -f /login/file.cfg=; see https://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/doc/ncftpget.html.

Notes:
1) There may be some issues with the pull mechanism; notably, if files change during the pull, NcFTP will behave in an undefined manner.
2) It is vastly preferable that all files be given unique names, OR be continuously concatenable - that is to say, if a file is downloaded and removed at any point, its replacement can be directly concatenated to the end of that file to express a larger file which would have existed if the original file had not been removed. Most data formats can handle this.
3) The files on different local networks don't need to be unique.
4) Non-UNIX based FTP servers will not work to pull from, unfortunately. To push to, a DOS-based FTP server is (probably) fine, but I've yet to test. (The only possible stop might be the ASCII mode, as UNIX and DOS pick different line terminators - but I believe NcFTP handles this natively.)
